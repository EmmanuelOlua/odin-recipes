            <li> Salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <h3> Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> <p> Chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a teaspoon of salt, half 
                cup of sliced onions, a teaspoon of thyme spice, a teaspoon of curry, 
                two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of powdered ginger and garlic). </p>

            <p> Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and 
                deep fry. Be sure to reserve the stock (meat water)</p>
            </li>
            <li> <p>
                Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray.</p>

            <p> This process is easy, I normally use just a knife and chopping board or a tray.</p>

            </li>
            <li> <p> Parboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the 
                meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about 70% done.</p>

            <p> You have to observe the rice closely. It doesn’t need to be too soft or too hard, just 
                almost done.</p>
            </li>

        <h3> Step by step</h3> 
        <li> <p> Set your cooking pot on heat, allow to dry, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable 
            oil.</p>

        <p> Note: It is better to continue with the same oil you used while frying the meat (that 
            is only if you fried the meats), you can reduce it to 200ml.</p>
        </li>   
        <li> Allow heating then add the sliced onions stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>

        <li> <p> </p>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go 
            first.</p>

            <img src="images/fried-rice-with-chicken/frying-carrot-bean.jpg"> 
        <p> Add the chopped liver and sweet corn, stir.</p>

        <p> Meat stock (water from the meat) should follow, add ground pepper (optional), 
            add a teaspoon of salt and, add 1 seasoning cube then stir and taste, you may 
            add more salt.</p>

        <p> Add the green peas.</p>

        <p> Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish 
            spice that actually adds the yellowish color to fried rice, add and stir till you are 
            satisfied with the color.)</p>

        <p> You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, don’t 
            worry the rice would balance the taste.</p>

        <p> If you are satisfied with the taste then add the green pepper, stir.</p>
