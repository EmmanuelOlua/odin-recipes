        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p> A typical egusi soup comprises of the following ingredients: egusi, meat, fish, 
            dried fish, stockfish, peppers, seasonings, onions, 
            red palm oil, water and vegetables (for eg. bitter leaves, fluted pumpkin leaves or ugu, 
            spinach).In the absence of the egusi seeds, pumpkin seeds can equally serve as 
            a great substitute for egusi.</p> 

           <p> Egusi with bitter leaf soup does not have to be difficult nor daunting to cook. 
            When cooking a delicious soup such as this, I recommend that you 
            gather the best ingredients you can lay your hands on. </p>
